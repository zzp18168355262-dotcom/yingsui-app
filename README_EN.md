Shadowing English is an English shadowing app for turning videos you already own into deliberate listening and speaking practice. Import local videos and subtitles, work through real scenes sentence by sentence, and keep your media on your own device. This project does not provide videos, courses, or subtitle packs.

## What is Shadowing English

English shadowing is more than repeating a line once. It puts listening and speaking in the same real-video context: understand the scene, identify what you hear, then imitate the speaker's timing, connected speech, intonation, and pronunciation.

Use the videos you genuinely want to watch as subtitle-based English learning material. Saved words and phrases stay connected to the original scene instead of becoming an isolated list.

## How the shadowing method works

1. **Understand**: Use bilingual subtitles to grasp the scene, context, and emotion.
2. **Listen**: Switch to English subtitles, navigate sentence by sentence, and replay difficult lines.
3. **Shadow**: Reduce subtitle support and imitate the speaker's rhythm, linking, stress, intonation, and pronunciation.

Short loops keep auditory recognition and spoken output together. A few lines at a time can move you from reading subtitles to understanding and saying the line yourself.

## Key features

- **Local video import**: Build a personal library from video folders on your device.
- **Subtitle import and matching**: Import `.srt` or `.vtt` files; match subtitles to videos from filenames and episode markers.
- **Sentence-level navigation**: Tap a subtitle line to jump to the right point in the video.
- **Replay and loop a line**: Replay the current sentence quickly or enable sentence looping.
- **Subtitle modes**: Switch among English, bilingual, and hidden subtitles as you progress.
- **Word lookup from subtitles**: Tap a word for its definition while it is still in context.
- **Full word-by-word transcript**: The active sentence and word follow playback in the complete transcript reader.
- **Tap words in video subtitles**: Look up words directly from the subtitle over the video.
- **Saved words and phrases**: Keep useful vocabulary and expressions in dedicated review spaces.
- **Shadowing practice**: Record each shadowing session as part of your learning activity.
- **Learning progress**: Track study time, sentences, phrases, course progress, levels, and achievements.
- **Optional AI subtitles**: Generate or switch subtitles for videos without them using your own provider configuration.
- **Local first**: Your videos, subtitles, and learning records remain centered on your device.

## Why use Shadowing English

- **Start with videos you want to watch**: Learn English with videos you care about instead of a fixed course pack.
- **Keep language in context**: Words, lines, and phrases come from real dialogue.
- **Repeat the exact sentence**: Sentence navigation and loops support focused English listening practice and shadowing practice.
- **Practice listening and speaking together**: Understand first, then shadow the line, rather than leaving speaking for later.
- **Keep control of your material**: Local videos and subtitles are not collected or distributed by this project.

## Getting started

### Download

The latest release is [v0.1.1](https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english/releases/tag/v0.1.1). It includes packages for:

- Android: APK
- macOS: DMG
- Linux: x64 `.tar.gz`
- Windows: x64 `.zip`

Visit [Releases](https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english/releases/latest) to download the package for your platform.

Starting with v0.1.2, each release includes `SHA256SUMS.txt` to verify downloaded files.

### Run from source

Flutter 3.44.4 is required and pinned through FVM. Install [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation) before the first run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english.git
cd shadowing-english
fvm use 3.44.4
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
```

In VS Code, install the Flutter and Dart extensions, open the project root, select `Flutter - Prod (select device)` from Run and Debug, then press F5. The project uses the pinned SDK through `.fvm/flutter_sdk`; do not commit machine-specific SDK paths, device IDs, or secrets.

If you use your own Flutter installation, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Import learning materials

Use matching episode names for video and subtitle files when possible:

```text
Friends-S01E01.mp4
Friends-S01E01.en.srt
Friends-S01E01.zh.srt
```

An English subtitle can also use the exact base name, such as `Friends-S01E01.srt`. The matcher recognizes filename markers including `.en`, `_en`, and `english`. Only import media and subtitles you are allowed to use.

Read [RESOURCE_SETUP.md](RESOURCE_SETUP.md) for more detail. This repository does not include video content, commercial subtitle packs, or unauthorized learning materials.

## Privacy

- Videos, subtitles, and learning records are stored and managed around your local device.
- The project does not host or distribute your course materials.
- If you enable AI subtitles or translation, requests are sent to the third-party provider you configure.

## Contributing

[Issues](https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english/issues) are welcome, especially for subtitle matching, playback, and cross-platform problems. Please open an Issue before a substantial pull request, and do not submit unauthorized video, subtitle, or course resources.
