Shadowing English is an English shadowing app for turning videos you already own into deliberate listening and speaking practice. Import local videos and subtitles, work through real scenes sentence by sentence, and keep your media on your own device. This project does not provide videos, courses, or subtitle packs.

## What is Shadowing English

English shadowing is more than repeating a line once. It puts listening and speaking in the same real-video context: understand the scene, identify what you hear, then imitate the speaker's timing, connected speech, intonation, and pronunciation.

Use the videos you genuinely want to watch as subtitle-based English learning material. Saved words and phrases stay connected to the original scene instead of becoming an isolated list.

## How the shadowing method works

1. **Understand**: Use bilingual subtitles to grasp the scene, context, and emotion.
2. **Listen**: Switch to English subtitles, navigate sentence by sentence, and replay difficult lines.
3. **Shadow**: Reduce subtitle support and imitate the speaker's rhythm, linking, stress, intonation, and pronunciation.

Short loops keep auditory recognition and spoken output together. A few lines at a time can move you from reading subtitles to understanding and saying the line yourself.

## Key features

- **Local video import**: Build a personal library from video folders on your device.
- **Subtitle import and matching**: Import `.srt` or `.vtt` files; match subtitles to videos from filenames and episode markers.
- **Sentence-level navigation**: Tap a subtitle line to jump to the right point in the video.
- **Replay and loop a line**: Replay the current sentence quickly or enable sentence looping.
- **Subtitle modes**: Switch among English, bilingual, and hidden subtitles as you progress.
- **Word lookup from subtitles**: Tap a word for its definition while it is still in context.
- **Full word-by-word transcript**: The active sentence and word follow playback in the complete transcript reader.
- **Tap words in video subtitles**: Look up words directly from the subtitle over the video.
- **Saved words and phrases**: Keep useful vocabulary and expressions in dedicated review spaces.
- **Shadowing practice**: Record each shadowing session as part of your learning activity.
- **Learning progress**: Track study time, sentences, phrases, course progress, levels, and achievements.
- **Optional AI subtitles**: Generate or switch subtitles for videos without them using your own provider configuration.
- **Local first**: Your videos, subtitles, and learning records remain centered on your device.

## Subtitles: from import to word-level shadowing

Shadowing English does more than display one subtitle line over a video. It turns subtitles into a learning timeline you can navigate, loop, search, and shadow. Choose the workflow that fits your material:

- **Import external subtitles**: `.srt` and `.vtt` files are supported. This is the most direct option when you already have good subtitles; English and Chinese tracks can be matched automatically by filename.
- **Switch embedded subtitle tracks**: If a video contains selectable subtitle tracks, choose one from the player's subtitle menu without extracting it first.
- **Generate word-level synced subtitles with AI**: When no subtitle is available, or an existing subtitle only has sentence-level timing, AI can analyze the audio and create start and end times for each English word.

### How to use AI subtitles

1. Open Settings and find “AI生成可跟读的词级同步字幕” (AI-generated word-level synced subtitles). Select an ASR provider and enter your own API key. Alibaba Cloud Model Studio is the default, and the other providers listed in Settings are also supported.
2. Keep “生成双语字幕” (Generate bilingual subtitles) enabled and configure a translation service if you want English and Chinese. Turn it off if you only need English.
3. Import and play a video, then select “AI生成可跟读的词级同步字幕” in the player. The app shows recognition progress while it works.
4. Once complete, the subtitle is stored locally and loaded for playback. Open Settings → “管理 AI 字幕” (Manage AI subtitles) to review it, edit individual words, export it, regenerate it, or delete it.

Generation calls the third-party services you select and may incur a small charge. Enter API keys only in the app's settings; never commit them to the repository or expose them in screenshots or public logs.

### How it works

```text
Local video
  → extract and split audio on the device
  → recognize English and word timestamps through an ASR service
  → merge, validate, and repair the timeline locally
  → optionally generate Chinese translations
  → save locally and highlight each word during playback
```

When usable English external or embedded subtitles are available, the app can use them as a reference: the more complete source text is preserved while speech recognition supplies or calibrates word timing. Reference subtitles are not silently overwritten, and the app reports when recognition results or timestamps require repair. Without a reference, the English text and timeline are generated directly from the video's audio.

### Why it is better than ordinary subtitles

- **Word-level sync, not only sentence-level sync**: The active word follows playback, making connected speech, reductions, and stress easier to notice.
- **Subtitles become learning controls**: Tap a sentence to seek, loop a difficult line, look up a word, or follow the current position in the full transcript reader.
- **Existing subtitles remain valuable**: A reliable source subtitle can provide the text while AI focuses on word timing, reducing omissions and transcription mistakes.
- **Generated results stay manageable**: Subtitles are stored locally and can be edited, exported, regenerated, or deleted without calling the service every time you play the video.
- **Usable results are preserved where possible**: Common timestamp overlaps and missing word timings are repaired locally. If Chinese translation is incomplete, the generated English subtitle is kept whenever possible.

AI recognition can still be affected by background music, overlapping speakers, accents, and recording quality. For important material, use an existing subtitle as a reference and review the result in Manage AI Subtitles before relying on it long-term.

## Why use Shadowing English

- **Start with videos you want to watch**: Learn English with videos you care about instead of a fixed course pack.
- **Keep language in context**: Words, lines, and phrases come from real dialogue.
- **Repeat the exact sentence**: Sentence navigation and loops support focused English listening practice and shadowing practice.
- **Practice listening and speaking together**: Understand first, then shadow the line, rather than leaving speaking for later.
- **Keep control of your material**: Local videos and subtitles are not collected or distributed by this project.

## Getting started

### Download

The latest release is [v0.1.1](https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english/releases/tag/v0.1.1). It includes packages for:

- Android: APK
- macOS: DMG
- Linux: x64 `.tar.gz`
- Windows: x64 `.zip`

Visit [Releases](https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english/releases/latest) to download the package for your platform.

Starting with v0.1.2, each release includes `SHA256SUMS.txt` to verify downloaded files.

### Run from source

Flutter 3.44.4 is required and pinned through FVM. Install [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation) before the first run.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english.git
cd shadowing-english
fvm use 3.44.4
fvm flutter pub get
fvm flutter run
```

In VS Code, install the Flutter and Dart extensions, open the project root, select `Flutter - Prod (select device)` from Run and Debug, then press F5. The project uses the pinned SDK through `.fvm/flutter_sdk`; do not commit machine-specific SDK paths, device IDs, or secrets.

If you use your own Flutter installation, run:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Import learning materials

Use matching episode names for video and subtitle files when possible:

```text
Friends-S01E01.mp4
Friends-S01E01.en.srt
Friends-S01E01.zh.srt
```

An English subtitle can also use the exact base name, such as `Friends-S01E01.srt`. The matcher recognizes filename markers including `.en`, `_en`, and `english`. Only import media and subtitles you are allowed to use.

Read [RESOURCE_SETUP.md](RESOURCE_SETUP.md) for more detail. This repository does not include video content, commercial subtitle packs, or unauthorized learning materials.

## Privacy

- Videos, subtitles, and learning records are stored and managed around your local device.
- The project does not host or distribute your course materials.
- If you enable AI subtitles or translation, requests are sent to the third-party provider you configure.

## Contributing

[Issues](https://github.com/MarkYuanGo/shadowing-english/issues) are welcome, especially for subtitle matching, playback, and cross-platform problems. Please open an Issue before a substantial pull request, and do not submit unauthorized video, subtitle, or course resources.
